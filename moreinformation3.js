CAPM

The capital asset pricing model - or CAPM - 
is a financial model that calculates the 
expected rate of return for an asset or investment. 
CAPM does this by using the expected return on both the market 
and a risk-free asset, and the asset's correlation or 
sensitivity to the market (beta).


A tangency portfolio is a portfolio that lies 
at the point where the efficient frontier is 
tangent to the highest possible capital market line (CML) 
in the risk-return space. This portfolio offers the highest 
risk-adjusted return for a given level of risk, 
combining optimal 
diversification and asset allocation.

Arbitrage pricing theory
Arbitrage pricing theory (APT) 
is a multi-factor asset pricing 
model based on the idea that an 
asset's returns can be predicted 
using the linear relationship between the asset's expected 
return and a number of macroeconomic variables that capture systematic risk.

 The Formula for the Arbitrage Pricing Theory Model Is

E(R)i=E(R)z+(E(I)−E(R)z)×βn where: E(R)i=Expected return on the assetRz=Risk-free rate of returnβn=Sensitivity of the asset price to macroeconomicfactor nEi=Risk premium associated with factor i​E(R)i​=E(R)z​+(E(I)−E(R)z​)×βn​where:E(R)i​=Expected return on the assetRz​=Risk-free rate of returnβn​=Sensitivity of the asset price 
to macroeconomicfactor nEi=Risk premium associated with factor i​

 How the Arbitrage Pricing Theory Works

The arbitrage pricing theory was developed by the 
economist Stephen Ross in 1976, as an 
alternative to the capital asset pricing model 
(CAPM). Unlike the CAPM, which assume markets are 
perfectly efficient, APT assumes markets sometimes misprice 
securities, before the market eventually corrects and 
securities move back to fair value. Using APT, arbitrageurs 
hope to take advantage of any deviations from fair market value.

However, this is not a risk-free operation in the classic sense of arbitrage, because investors are assuming that the model is correct 
and making directional trades—rather than locking in risk-free profits. 

 Mathematical Model for the APT

While APT is more flexible than the CAPM, it is more complex. The CAPM only takes into account one factor—market risk—while the APT formula has multiple factors. And it takes a considerable amount of research to determine how sensitive a security is to various macroeconomic risks.

The factors as well as how many of them are used are subjective choices, which means investors will have varying results depending on their choice. However, four or five factors will usually explain most of a security's return. (For more on the differences between the CAPM and APT, read more about how CAPM and arbitrage pricing theory differ.)

APT factors are the systematic risk that cannot be reduced by the diversification of an investment portfolio. The macroeconomic factors that have proven most reliable as price predictors include unexpected changes in inflation, gross national product (GNP), corporate bond spreads and shifts in the yield curve. Other commonly used factors are gross domestic product (GDP), commodities prices, market indices, and exchange rates.
Key Takeaways

    Arbitrage pricing theory (APT) is a multi-factor asset pricing model based on the idea that an asset's returns can be predicted using the linear relationship between the asset’s expected return and a number of macroeconomic variables that capture systematic risk.
    Unlike the CAPM, which assume markets are perfectly efficient, APT assumes markets sometimes misprice securities, before the market eventually corrects and securities move back to fair value.
    Using APT, arbitrageurs hope to take advantage of any deviations from fair market value.

Example of How Arbitrage Pricing Theory Is Used

For example, the following four factors have been identified as explaining a stock's return and its sensitivity to each factor and the risk premium associated with each factor have been calculated:

    Gross domestic product (GDP) growth: ß = 0.6, RP = 4%
    Inflation rate: ß = 0.8, RP = 2%
    Gold prices: ß = -0.7, RP = 5%
    Standard and Poor's 500 index return: ß = 1.3, RP = 9%
    The risk-free rate is 3%

Using the APT formula, the expected return is calculated as:

    Expected return = 3% + (0.6 x 4%) + (0.8 x 2%) + (-0.7 x 5%) + (1.3 x 9%) = 15.2%

Mammography is an x-ray of the breast 
that uses low doses of radiation. 

The picture made during mammography 
is called a mammogram. It can help 
find both cancerous (malignant)
 and non-cancerous (benign) tumours
  in the breast.

  Having a mammogram is uncomfortable
   for most women. 
   Some women find it painful. 
   A mammogram takes only a few moments, 
   though, and the discomfort is over soon.
    What you feel depends on the skill

#1. Feign Disappointment 

Power negotiators will purposefully act disappointed during negotiations.

Studies show that looking disappointed is likely to decrease your demands and increase the size of your concessions because you unconsciously feel like you need to give more to rebalance the relationship.

Powerful negotiators will act like they don’t like your offer, even if they are very happy.
They do it for two reasons:

1. They can get even happier by faking being unhappy and asking for more 2. If they look happy, you might decrease your offer or think twice about it

This is especially important on the first offer. As a matter of fact, power movers rarely take the first offer at all.
Dirty-Negotiation Buster

When they play unhappy, tell them that, unfortunately, there is not so much room for such a good offer of yours.
But if they tell you what they’re looking for, you’ll take it to your guys (this is the “higher authority game”, more on it later).

roll the windows down, turn the music up and make an ass out of yourself it puts women at ease
never show your impressed it lowers your market value


#2. Say: “You’ll have to do better than that“

Simple technique, the dirty negotiator just says:

    Power Negotiator: You’ll have to do better than that

Then he stays silent and waits for you to take a step back and make a concession.
Dirty-Negotiation Buster

Here is how you answer:

    Power Negotiator: You’ll have to do better than that
    You: How much better exactly

This way you keep control of the interaction while also avoiding unneeded escalations.

Here are techniques of social manipulation:
1. Social Manipulation (Social Scalping)

    Social scalping is a form of social exchange manipulation, that seeks to inflate one’s own contribution and devalue the victim’s contribution as a way of taking more than they give

Social scalping is a way of exploiting the social exchange system.

Let’s take “debt inflating”, for example.

One of the most basic social exchange rules postulates that people who feel indebted to others will feel an obligation to give back. 
That obligation is based on what Cialdini called “reciprocity” (Cialdini, 1994). Reciprocity is the feeling of indebtedness that, if someone gave us, then we owe them. 

That’s what the social scalper exploits.
The social scalper makes you feel indebted so that he can get back more than he gives.

He does it in many ways:

    Makes the favor seem “special”: “This is just for you, don’t tell anyone else” (and then does the exact same with anyone else)
    Makes the favor seem costly: “It took me 3 days of 12h work a day. But I know you needed it” (and maybe it took him just one day)
    Reminds you of old favor he’s done for you: “Remember that time you had to move, and I helped you out? Well, now I’m just asking you for $100 bucks man” (and maybe you thought that “favor” was part of your friendship, and repaid with the dinner and drinks you offered)

Here’s an overview of social exchange manipulation:

//// picture 

Thanks to Ali & Matthew on the infographics thread

Don’t sweat it if it seems too complex.
In short, this infographic says that the manipulator seeks to get more, while giving back less.

It’s simpler with some real life examples:

    Tinder player seeks to manipulate the TPM community: he tried to manipulate me by inflating his contribution, deflating the value I was giving, and demanding quick action for the imbalance
    Woman spins leftover into a gift: she tries to receive undeserved social credit by spinning a leftover into a thoughtful gift

To deal with this social manipulation, read here:

    Social scalping counter-strategy: a real-life example of a “debt inflating” and playing the same game back on her.

There is a fairer, non-manipulative way of making sure you get back what you gave.
And it’s to make it clear you expect something back.

    Honest exchange talk: directly lets you know you’ll have to make a favor back

An example of “honest exchange talk” from “The Godfather”:

    Godfather: some day, and that day may never come, I’ll call upon you to do a service. But until that day, accept this as a wedding gift

It might be annoying to have someone tell you “you owe me”, or that they “might have to call you in the future”. But at least, you know what you’re getting. Fair deal.

economic information 
in order to identify the 
superordinate relationships 
between patent applications
 and technological 
and market trends among other things.

Intellectual Property Law includes 
patents, copyrights, trademarks, 
and trade secrets. All of these 
areas are related in that they
 deal with protecting products of the mind 
but in other ways they are very different.

Computer peripherals are external devices that enhance your machine's functionality through better performance, design, sound quality and more. Add-ons range from essential input devices like keyboards,

What the?

OKWS is the Web server that powers OkCupid.com, specialized for building fast and secure Web services. It provides Web developers with a small set of tools that has proved powerful enough to build complex systems with limited effort. Despite its emphasis on security, OKWS shows performance advantages relative to popular competitors. Commercial experience with OKWS suggests that the system can reduce hardware and system management costs, while providing security guarantees absent in current systems.

As of Dec 2011, OKWS is still being maintained and worked on, with 3.1 being the active development version. There are no big feature-development plans on the horizon, but we're regularly committing bugfixes and extensions.
Software Packages
The main OKWS software package also depends upon the sfslite programming libraries for C++. They are currently released separately, though in the future might be bundled together for ease of installation.

chroot system call ////////////

A chroot is an operation 
that changes the apparent 
root directory for the current 
running process and their children.
 A program that is run in such a 
 modified environment cannot access 
 files and commands outside that 
 environmental directory tree. 
This modified environment is called a chroot jail.

If you are root inside a chroot you can escape creating another chroot. This because 2 chroots cannot coexists (in Linux), so if you create a folder and then create a new chroot on that new folder being you outside of it, you will now be outside of the new chroot 
and therefore you will be in the FS.

How do I exit chroot command?
Basically chroot makes the environment believe provided path is the root “/” of the filesystem. We can exit from chrooted environment by pressing Ctrl-D. chroot can be used to build chroot jail to protect server services for preventing attacker to gain complete access to the server by creating chroot jails.

in Unix you basically have to have uid 0 in order
to chroot a process

A symlink is a symbolic Linux/ UNIX link that points to another file or folder on your computer, or a connected file system. This is similar to a Windows shortcut. Symlinks can take two forms: Soft links are similar to shortcuts, and can point to another file or directory in any file system.

A symbolic link is a file system object that points to another file system object that is called the target. Symbolic links are transparent to users. The links appear as normal files or directories, and they can be acted upon by the user or application in exactly the same manner.

How to Create a Symbolic Link in Linux

There are various ways to create symbolic links depending on how you want to use them. The basic syntax to create a symlink is as follows:

ln -s </target-directory/target-file> </symlink-directory/example-symlink>

The -s switch is important because it tells the Linux ln command to create a soft link instead of a hard link. The </symlink-directory/> is optional. If not specified, the symlink is created in the current working directory.
Note
When you use the Linux ln command in a shell script, the command returns true (0) on success.
Creating a Symlink to a File

The following example command creates the symlink-file symlink in the current directory, which points to /tmp/reference-file:

ln -s /tmp/reference-file symlink-file

Note
In this example, the file pathname is absolute. You can create a symlink with a relative path. However, make sure that anything using the symlink first sets the current working directory, otherwise the link is broken.

Creating a Symlink to a Directory/Folder

The same command can also be used to create a symlink that points to a directory. The following example command creates the symlink-directory symlink in the current directory, which points to /tmp/reference-directory:

ln -s /tmp/reference-directory symlink-directory

Any reference to symlink-directory acts on the directory /tmp/reference-directory. This includes adding or deleting files in the directory, changing the ownership, and changing the permission if allowed.
Force Overwriting of a Symbolic Link

If the path in a symlink is wrong, for example a typo, or the target has moved, you can update the link using the -f flag:

ln -sf /tmp/new-reference-directory symlink-directory

This results in the old symlink’s contents being replaced with the new. The -f switch automatically removes any conflicting symlink-filepath files or symlinks if there is a conflict. Making a symlink without the -f switch, using a sympath-name that is already in use, results in the command failing.
Display the Contents of a Symlink

To show the contents of a symlink, use the Linux ls command:

ls -l symlink-directory

The output looks like this:

symlink-file -> /tmp/reference-file

Using Linux Symlinks

Almost all file-based actions on a symlink act on or affect the target file, but not the symlink or symlink chain itself. Therefore touch, chmod, chown, chgrp, shell redirection, and their program/script equivalents all act on the target file/directory and its attributes. When the file is open, all read and write activity accesses or modifies the target file. However, there are exceptions, described in the next section.

Removing Symlinks

The exceptions to the above-described rule are the Linux commands unlink, rm, rmdir, and their associated system calls. These commands either fail or remove the symlink itself instead of the target file or directory. These exceptions prevent the inadvertent removal of the target.

See more information about removing symlinks in our Remove Symbolic Links.
Finding Dangling Symlinks

A dangling symlink occurs when the target does not exist. The original file may have been deleted or moved to another part of the file system tree.

While breaking a symlink can be intentional, dangling symlinks can clutter up the file system if not intended. To find these dangling symlinks within a file system tree, use this command:



find </directory/to/search> -xtype l

Note
Do not immediately pipe this to the rm command. Investigate first, so you can repair inadvertently broken symlinks.

inodes /////

The inode (index node) is a data structure in a Unix-style file system that describes a file-system object such as a file or a directory. Each inode stores the attributes and disk block locations of the object's data.
