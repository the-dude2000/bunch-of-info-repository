USE SELECTIVE HONESTY AND GENEROSITY TO DISARM YOUR VICTIM
One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones. 0pen~hea7ted gestures of honesty and
gertemsity bring down the guard ofeven the most suspicions people. Once your selective honesty opens a hole in
their armor; you can deceive and manipulate them at will. A timely gzfl-ma ’}i‘q,v'an horse-——zoill serve the same
purpose.

WHEN ASKING FOR HELP, APPEAL TO PEOPLE’S SELF INTEREST,
NEVER TO THEIR MERCY OR GRATITUDE
Ifyou need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him ofyour past assistance and good deeds. He
willfind a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that
will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion, He will respond enthusiastically when he sees some-
thing to be gained for himself

PLAY ON PEOPLE'S NEED TO BELIEVE TO CREATE A CULTLIKE FOLLOWING
People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. Become thefocal point of such desire by ojj‘m'ng
them a cause, a nemfaith to follow. Keep your wants vague but full of promise; emphasize enthusiasm over
rationality and clear thinking. Give your new disciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifices on your

power.

LAW 28 page 227
ENTER ACTION WITH BOLDNESS
Ifyou are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execu-
tion, Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit through audacity are eas»
ily corrected with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the léfllid.

PLAN ALL THE WAY TO THE END
The ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles,
and twists offortune that might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others. By planning to the end
you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop. Gently guidefortune and help

LA‘/V 30 page 245
MAKE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS SEEM EFFORTLESS
Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the toil and practice that go into them, and also
all the clever tricks, must be concealed. When you act, act eflortlessly, as zfyou could do much more. Avoid the
temptation of -revealing how hard you wurk—it only raises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be
used against you.

LAW 31 page 25-?
CONTROL THE OPTIONS: GET OTHERS TO PLAY WITH THE CARDS YOU DEAL
The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice: Your victimsfeel they are in control,
but are actually your puppets. Give people options that some out in yourfavor whichever one they choose, Force
them to make choices between the lesser oftwo evils, both ofwhich serve your purpose. Put them on the horns of
a dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn.

LAW 3 2 page 263
PLAY TO PEOPLES FANTASIES
The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unjbleasant. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are
preparedfor the anger that comes from disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can
manufacture romance or conjure npfarztasy are like oases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great
power in tapping into thefantasies ofthe masses.

DISCOVER EACH MAN'S THUMBSCREW
Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness is usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable
emotion or need; it can also be a smafl secret pleasure. Either may, oncefound, it is a thumbscrew you can turn
to your advantage.

BE ROYAL IN YOUR OWN FASHION: ACT LIKE A KING TO BE TREATED LIKE ONE
The way you carry yourselfwill often determine how you are treated: In the long run, appearing vulgar or com-
mon will make people disrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By
acting regally and confident ofyour powers, you make yourselfseem destined to wear a crown.

LAVV 33 page 291
MASTER THE ART OF TIMING
Never seem to be in a hurry—hurrying betrays a lack of control over yourself: and over time. Always seem pa-
tient, as ifyou know that everything will come to you eventually. Become a detective of the right moment; Sniff
out the spirit of the times, the trends that will carry you to power: Learn to stand back when the time is not yet
ripe, and to strikefiercely when it has reachedfruition.

LAVV 36 page 300
DISDAIN THINGS YOU CANNOT HAVE: IGNORING THEM IS THE BEST REVENGE
By acknowledging a petgr problem you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy,
the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try tofix it. It
is sometimes best to leave things alone. Ifthere is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it.
'I7te less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem.

CREATE COMPELLING SPECTACLES
Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura ofpower—e1/eryone responds to them. Stage spec-
tacles for those around you, then, full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence.
Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing.
LAVV 38 page 317
THINK AS YOU LIKE BUT BEHAVE LIKE OTHERS
Ifyou make a show ofgoing against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways,
people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They willfind a way to
punish youfor making themfeel inferior It isfar safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your

STIR UP WATERS TO CATCH FISH
Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must always stay calm and objective. But ifyou
can make your enemies angry while staying calm yourselfl you gain a decided advantage. Put your enemies
off-balance: Find the think in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings.

DESPISE THE FREE LUNCH
What is offeredforfree is dangenms—~it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation. What has worth
is worth paying for By paying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is also often wise
to pay thefull price-—there is no cutting corners with excellence. Be lavish with your money and keep it cirru-

AVOID STEPPING INTO A GREAT MAN'S SHOES
What happens first always appears better and more original than what comes after Ifyou succeed a great man
or have ajarnous parent, you will have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine them. Do not get
lost in their shadow, or stuck in a past not ofyour own making: Establish your own name and identity by
changing course. Slay the overbearingfathei; disparage his legacy, and gain power by shining in your own
way.

STRIKE THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEEP WILL SCATTER
Trouble can often be traced to a single strong indi-oidual——the stirrer, the arrogant underling, the poisoner of
goodwill. you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their influence. Do not wait for the
troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them—thty are irredeemable. Neutralize their in»
jluence by isolating or banishing them. Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will scatter.
LAVV 43 page 367
WORK ON THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OTHERS
Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you. You must seduce others into wanting to
move in your direction. A person you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn. And the way to seduce others is to
operate on their individualpsychologies and weaknesses. Soften up the resistant by working on their emotions,
playing on what they hold dear and what theyfear: Ignore the hearts and minds ofothers and they will grow to
hate you.

DISARM AND INFURIATE WITH THE MIRROR EFFECT
The mirror reflects reality, but it is also the perfect toolfor deception: When you mirror your enemies, doing ex~
actly as they do, they cannot figure out your strategy. The Mirror Eflect mocks and humiliates them, making
them overreact. By holding up a mirror to their psyehes, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their
values; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a lesson. Few can resist the power ofthe Mirror
Effect.

PREACH THE NEED FOR CHANGE, BUT NEVER REFORM TOO MUCH AT ONCE
Everyone understands the need for change in the abstract, but on the day-to-day level people are creatures of
habit. Too much innovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt. Ifyou are new to a position ofpower, or an
outsider trying to build a power base, make a show of respecting the old way of doing things. If change is nec-
essary, make itfeel like a gentle improvement on the past.

NEVER APPEAR TOO PERFECT
Appearing better than others is always dungwmcs, but most drmgmms ofall is to appear to have no fault: or
weaknesses. Envy mates silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless
vices, in order to dcflect envy and appear more human and apfiwctchable. Only guds and the dead can seem
pevfect with impunity.

PSYCHOLOGY

#4 Do A Little Experiment

Do A Little Experiment

This is a fun little experiment to try - when you are having a conversation with someone, pick out one word that they say. Each time that the person says that word (or something close to it), just nod or give some other type of positive affirmation. Now watch your conversation partner 
start saying the word all the time.

#5 Stop Procrastinating

Stop Procrastinating

If you're a procrastinator and have important tasks coming up that can't be put off – try thinking about the task before you sleep. It will force your brain to act on them mentally and your brain will start to draw a pathway to the completion of the task. Simply put – before doing a task in the physical world, do it in your head first. When you get to it in your real life, the brain will have already processed a huge chunk of the task, making it easier for you to actually finish it.

#6 Spot Office Romances

Spot Office Romances

While laughing in a group of people, we tend to glance at the person that we feel closest to. This can be an easy way to spot any office romances going on.

 Our brains are wired to believe that we're safe whenever we're eating.

#13 Listen To Classical Music While Studying

Listen To Classical Music While Studying

According to one study, it was found that rap and hip hop negatively affect GPA, while listening to classical and easy music positively affected GPA. It is thought that the reason behind this is that the vocals in the music are naturally distracting – we, as humans, are more reactive to vocal sounds than to non-vocal ones. Therefore, when learning something new – try listening to some classical music or songs without lyrics.

#15 Make Your Kids To Finally Eat Vegetables

Make Your Kids To Finally Eat Vegetables

Every parent knows the struggle of trying to make your kids eat their vegetables. The trick? Instead of asking them if they want any broccoli at all (or any kind of vegetable for that matter), ask them whether they'd like three or five pieces of veg (the quantity is up to you). It'll make kids feel as if they've made a grown-up choice and they'll still be getting their nutrients. It's a win-win!

The brain and the body both exchange feedback simultaneously, therefore consequently, one affects the other in numerous ways. Fake smiling will engage similar neural networks as a genuine smile would. This means that faking a smile (or any other kind of expression of joy) can lift your mood.

#18 Alleviate Motion Sickness

Alleviate Motion Sickness

Motion sickness happens when your vestibular system tells the brain that you're moving, while your eyes are looking at something that is still and informs the brain that you are actually stationary. This clash results in motion sickness. To alleviate it – try looking outside the window as this way, your brain will understand that you're actually moving.

#19 Learn Wiser

Learn Wiser

If you have a lot of content which you need to learn, try learning it in chunks of relevant information instead of trying to memorize the whole thing in one sitting. This method of studying is a combination of two psychological processes called 'interleaving' and 'chunking'. For example, if you have a large text to memorize, instead of cramming it whole, read two or three related topics about it and then get back to your main paper. Similar topics are filled with information that will later fit into the larger framework, which will then make easier for you to comprehend the whole topic. Also, processing the information in chunks makes your brain retain the information much easier.

#23 Don't Be The Middle Guy

Don't Be The Middle Guy

An easy way to make an impression on someone that is interviewing you for a job - don't be the person in the middle. Simply put - try to be either the first or the last interviewee. People tend to have the clearest memories of something that happened either in the beginning or at the end of something, and our minds easily blur everything that happened in between.

#26 Drop The Annoying Habit

Drop The Annoying Habit

An amazing thing about our brain is that it is extremely gullible and will believe anything you say – therefore, you can use this trait to your advantage. Firstly, you need to have a trigger – a thing that scares you, like social anxiety for instance. Then, for example, if you want to quit an unhealthy habit, like biting your nails, lie to your brain that you biting your nails will result in some scary social situation. Bear in mind, that this should be used for good purposes only. Don't tell your brain that you're unworthy, incompetent or stupid – because while it is not true, you can easily make your brain believe it.

#27 Appear Wiser

Appear Wiser

If you want people to take you a little bit more seriously, each time you give advice you can tell them that it's 'what your father taught you.' People by nature tend to trust father figures.

#28 Memorize Your Grocery List Easily

Memorize Your Grocery List Easily

The mnemonic peg system is a memory aid that works by creating mental associations between two objects. Generally, the system includes linking nouns to numbers and it is usual to choose a noun that will rhyme with the number you want to associate it with. Let's say, the third product in your grocery list is a soap. Three rhymes with tree, therefore you can try imagining a tree with bars of soap hanging from its branches. Ridiculous, yet effective. Try making your imaginary story as dramatic as possible, as vivid visualization helps you to remember information easier.

Also, remember chunking? This technique was mentioned as one of the most efficient ways of retaining information. You can also apply chunking when trying to remember everyday things, such as your grocery list. Try grouping the items together, for example - vegetables could be your one group of items and bread products – another one.

f you haven't slept well, tell your brain "I slept well". You will feel fresh. It works like miracle.

Want to defeat a narcissist who insults you? Don't react. Just ignore him completely in front of others. It will hurt his image and he will stop poking you.

Want to know if someone is attentive or not? Repeat your sentence with a slight change in it. If he is listening either his facial expression will change or he will point out and question the part.

Want to know a person is lying to fit in a group? Just watch his eyes when he talks, if his eyes seeks validation from others for what he said, then he is pretending. A liar /pretender always seeks validation for his talks to fit in the group.

Giving a presentation ? Always bring a bottle of water to the stage. When you can’t remember what to say, take a drink. Nobody will know the difference.

nception.

This one’s my favourite. If you want to start a thought in someone’s mind, ask them to not think of that idea at all. For example I tell you NOT to think about DIAMONDS.

When someone is coming too strong on you with insults, insult yourself and laugh at yourself before they have the chance. Even your worst enemy will have nothing to say to you.

When you want something done, first ask for it, then back out, saying something like, ‘in fact, leave it, I’ll do it myself.’ It gets the other person wanting to do it for you more than ever.

Me: Hey, guess what, I was going to the store today and I …You own a store and all your items are priced as:

    $99.99 - We tend to read it as 99 and forget that it is just 1 cent less than a 100.
    4 cupcakes for 5$ and each for 1.29$. Most of the shoppers buy more than required just to save 4 cents on each piece without realizing that they have bought much more than required.
    Buy 3 and get 2 free. Most of us fall prey to this marketing strategy.

Friend: Yeah, I don’t care.
Me:…

Reverse Psychology trick

Me: Guess what… In fact, forget it.
Friend: What? Tell me.
Me: Nah it’s not important.
Friend: Tell me dude. Please…
Me: Fine, I’ll tell you…

It works like a charm in most situations, although, of course, you have to be smart where and how you use reverse psychology.

Some amazing psychological tricks and hacks to learn today:

    If you are angry, draw lines. Simple patterns relax you.

    If you feel sad, paint a rainbow.

    Tell someone who is angry that they have every right to feel that way if you want to calm them down. Don’t tell them to calm down.
    People who blush easily are generally more generous and trustworthy than those who don't.[1]
    When you become really close to someone, you can hear their voice in your head when you read their texts.
    If you think somebody is giving you a fake number, read it back to them incorrectly. See, if they correct you.
    People are generally more honest when they are physically tired and stressed. This is why people confess things during late night conversations.[2]
    Your thumb is the same length as your nose.[3]
    When you’re arguing with someone and start laughing, it will make them even madder. This is a great way to win a trivial argument.
    Daytime naps improve memory and cuts the risk of heart attacks.[4]
    Want someone's number at a party? Take a picture with them and ask them to send it to you.
    Psychology says that people who are lying to you tend to look up and to their left.[5]
    Silence tends to be the best way to let someone know that they did something wrong.
    Poor eyesight(myopia) is associated with higher IQ.[6]
    People will be more willing to do something for you if you ask them in their right ear.[7]
    If you feel hard to stay awake, drink two drinks: one hot and one cold. The combination stimulates the senses in your brain-- you’ll stay awake.[8]
    The most unexpected relationships and friendships tend to significantly last longer.
    Psychology says men tend to forget but never forgive. Women tend to forgive but never forget.[9]
    A person who enjoys being single is called Quirkyalone.
    A person usually makes a lot of hand gestures when telling a true story. When telling a lie, a person's hands will noticeably stay still.
    If you brush your teeth(and other small tasks) with the wrong hand, you force the brain to work differently. This will improve your self control.[10]
    “Study without desire spoils the memory, and it retains nothing that it takes in. ” - Leonardo da Vinci
    When you get an email or text that infuriates you, wait about an hour to respond. You’ll be surprised at how much rational you become.
    Smile before answering the phone. It will make you sound happier and will improve the quality of your conversation.
    Being surrounded by the colour yellow helps you stay focused. Yellow color decreases the production of melatonin, a hormone which makes you sleepy.[11]
    Adolescence is one of the period in life where humans sleep a lot.[12]
    A liar might unconsciously place objects like book, coffee cup, etc. between you and themselves while speaking.
    Talking about ourselves triggers the same sensation of pleasure in our brain as food or money.[13]
    Most of the problems in your life are due to two reasons: you act without thinking, or think without acting.
    The human mind can only maintain complete trust once for each person. Once broken, it's never the same.[14]
    Words don't have power to hurt you, unless the person means a lot to you.
    The way you talk to your children becomes their inner voice.
    School doesn't test your intelligence. It tests your memory.
    People with the highest IQ stay up late at night because their brains have increased mental stimulations.[15]
    If you stay up all night, your body will burn an extra 161 calories.[16]
    The most common lie is ‘I am fine'.

Deep learning uses artificial neural networks - allowing
them to process more complex patterns than traditional
machine learning

Neural networks can use both labeled and unlabeled data

This is called Semi-supervised learning

In semi-supervised learning a neural network is trained
on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount
of unlabeled data

The labeled data helps the neural network to learn the
basic concepts of the task while the unlabeled data 
helps the neural network to generalize to new examples

Generative AI is a subset of deep learning which
means it uses artificial neural networks, can process
both labeled and unlabeled data using supervised,unsupervised,
and semi-supervised methods

Large language models(LLMs) are also a subset of Deep
Learning

Deep learning models or machine learning models in 
general can be divided into 2 types: Generative
and Discriminative

Discriminative:

- Used to classify or predict
- Typically trained on a dataset of labeled data
- Learns the relationship between the features of the data
points and the labels

Generative:

- Generates new data that is similar to data it was trained
on 
- Understands distribution of data and how likely a
given example is
- Predict next word in a sequence

JAVA

Binary is a low level format

To understand binary we write source code

compile = transform source code to machine code

With Java there is an intermediary step where we can
compile our source code to a format called bytecode

Bytecode is cross platform and ends with a .class file extension

Jvm can translate bytecode to machine code

REACT TESTING

can put js and test together like test.js

Priority

Based on the Guiding Principles, your test should resemble how users interact with your code (component, page, etc.) as much as possible. With this in mind, we recommend this order of priority:

    Queries Accessible to Everyone Queries that reflect the experience of visual/mouse users as well as those that use assistive technology.
        getByRole: This can be used to query every element that is exposed in the accessibility tree. With the name option you can filter the returned elements by their accessible name. This should be your top preference for just about everything. There's not much you can't get with this (if you can't, it's possible your UI is inaccessible). Most often, this will be used with the name option like so: getByRole('button', {name: /submit/i}). Check the list of roles.
        getByLabelText: This method is really good for form fields. When navigating through a website form, users find elements using label text. This method emulates that behavior, so it should be your top preference.
        getByPlaceholderText: A placeholder is not a substitute for a label. But if that's all you have, then it's better than alternatives.
        getByText: Outside of forms, text content is the main way users find elements. This method can be used to find non-interactive elements (like divs, spans, and paragraphs).
        getByDisplayValue: The current value of a form element can be useful when navigating a page with filled-in values.
    Semantic Queries HTML5 and ARIA compliant selectors. Note that the user experience of interacting with these attributes varies greatly across browsers and assistive technology.
        getByAltText: If your element is one which supports alt text (img, area, input, and any custom element), then you can use this to find that element.
        getByTitle: The title attribute is not consistently read by screenreaders, and is not visible by default for sighted users
    Test IDs
        getByTestId: The user cannot see (or hear) these, so this is only recommended for cases where you can't match by role or text or it doesn't make sense (e.g. the text is dynamic).

userEvent comes with react testing library

Example

import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react' // (or /dom, /vue, ...)

test('should show login form', () => {
  render(<Login />)
  const input = screen.getByLabelText('Username')
  // Events and assertions...
})

Using Queries

The base queries from DOM Testing Library require you to pass a container as the first argument. Most framework-implementations of Testing Library provide a pre-bound version of these queries when you render your components with them which means you do not have to provide a container. In addition, if you just want to query document.body then you can use the screen export as demonstrated below (using screen is recommended).

The primary argument to a query can be a string, regular expression, or function. There are also options to adjust how node text is parsed. See TextMatch for documentation on what can be passed to a query.

Given the following DOM elements (which can be rendered by React, Vue, Angular, or plain HTML code):

<body>
  <div id="app">
    <label for="username-input">Username</label>
    <input id="username-input" />
  </div>
</body>

You can use a query to find an element (byLabelText, in this case):

import {screen, getByLabelText} from '@testing-library/dom'

// With screen:
const inputNode1 = screen.getByLabelText('Username')

// Without screen, you need to provide a container:
const container = document.querySelector('#app')
const inputNode2 = getByLabelText(container, 'Username')

queryOptions

You can pass a queryOptions object with the query type. See the docs for each query type to see available options, e.g. byRole API.
screen

All of the queries exported by DOM Testing Library accept a container as the first argument. Because querying the entire document.body is very common, DOM Testing Library also exports a screen object which has every query that is pre-bound to document.body (using the within functionality). Wrappers such as React Testing Library re-export screen so you can use it the same way.

Here's how you use it:

    Native
    React
    Angular
    Cypress

import {screen} from '@testing-library/dom'

document.body.innerHTML = `
  <label for="example">Example</label>
  <input id="example" />
`

const exampleInput = screen.getByLabelText('Example')

    Note

    You need a global DOM environment to use screen. If you're using jest, with the testEnvironment set to jsdom, a global DOM environment will be available for you.

    If you're loading your test with a script tag, make sure it comes after the body. An example can be seen here.

TextMatch

Most of the query APIs take a TextMatch as an argument, which means the argument can be either a string, regex, or a function of signature (content?: string, element?: Element | null) => boolean which returns true for a match and false for a mismatch.
TextMatch Examples

Given the following HTML:

<div>Hello World</div>

Will find the div:

// Matching a string:
screen.getByText('Hello World') // full string match
screen.getByText('llo Worl', {exact: false}) // substring match
screen.getByText('hello world', {exact: false}) // ignore case

// Matching a regex:
screen.getByText(/World/) // substring match
screen.getByText(/world/i) // substring match, ignore case
screen.getByText(/^hello world$/i) // full string match, ignore case
screen.getByText(/Hello W?oRlD/i) // substring match, ignore case, searches for "hello world" or "hello orld"

// Matching with a custom function:
screen.getByText((content, element) => content.startsWith('Hello'))

Will not find the div:

// full string does not match
screen.getByText('Goodbye World')

// case-sensitive regex with different case
screen.getByText(/hello world/)

// function looking for a span when it's actually a div:
screen.getByText((content, element) => {
  return element.tagName.toLowerCase() === 'span' && content.startsWith('Hello')
})

Precision

Queries that take a TextMatch also accept an object as the final argument that can contain options that affect the precision of string matching:

    exact: Defaults to true; matches full strings, case-sensitive. When false, matches substrings and is not case-sensitive.
        exact has no effect on regex or function arguments.
        exact has no effect on accessible names specified with the name option of *byRole queries. You can use a regex for fuzzy matching on accessible names.
        In most cases using a regex instead of a string gives you more control over fuzzy matching and should be preferred over { exact: false }.
    normalizer: An optional function which overrides normalization behavior. See Normalization.

Normalization

Before running any matching logic against text in the DOM, DOM Testing Library automatically normalizes that text. By default, normalization consists of trimming whitespace from the start and end of text, and collapsing multiple adjacent whitespace characters within the string into a single space.

If you want to prevent that normalization, or provide alternative normalization (e.g. to remove Unicode control characters), you can provide a normalizer function in the options object. This function will be given a string and is expected to return a normalized version of that string.

    Note

    Specifying a value for normalizer replaces the built-in normalization, but you can call getDefaultNormalizer to obtain a built-in normalizer, either to adjust that normalization or to call it from your own normalizer.

getDefaultNormalizer takes an options object which allows the selection of behaviour:

    trim: Defaults to true. Trims leading and trailing whitespace
    collapseWhitespace: Defaults to true. Collapses inner whitespace (newlines, tabs, repeated spaces) into a single space.

Normalization Examples

To perform a match against text without trimming:

screen.getByText('text', {
  normalizer: getDefaultNormalizer({trim: false}),
})

To override normalization to remove some Unicode characters whilst keeping some (but not all) of the built-in normalization behavior:

screen.getByText('text', {
  normalizer: str =>
    getDefaultNormalizer({trim: false})(str).replace(/[\u200E-\u200F]starslashhereg, ''),
})

Manual Queries

On top of the queries provided by the testing library, you can use the regular querySelector DOM API to query elements. Note that using this as an escape hatch to query by class or id is not recommended because they are invisible to the user. Use a testid if you have to, to make your intention to fall back to non-semantic queries clear and establish a stable API contract in the HTML.

// @testing-library/react
const {container} = render(<MyComponent />)
const foo = container.querySelector('[data-foo="bar"]')

Browser extension

Do you still have problems knowing how to use Testing Library queries?

There is a very cool Browser extension for Chrome named Testing Playground, and it helps you find the best queries to select elements. It allows you to inspect the element hierarchies in the Browser's Developer Tools, and provides you with suggestions on how to select them, while encouraging good testing practices.
Playground
If you want to get more familiar with these queries, you can try them out on testing-playground.com. Testing Playground is an interactive sandbox where you can run different queries against your own html, and get visual feedback matching the rules mentioned above.
