Warm and cold colors

Human eyes have color receptors known as cone cells, of which there are three types. In some cases, one is missing or faulty, which can cause color blindness, including the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green, known as deuteranopia or red-green color blindness.[17] Green is restful to the eye. Studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue.[18]

In the subtractive color system, used in painting and color printing, green is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. On the HSV color wheel, also known as the RGB color wheel, the complement of green is magenta; that is, a color corresponding to an equal mixture of red and blue light (one of the purples). On a traditional color wheel, based on subtractive color, the complementary color to green is considered to be red.[19]

In additive color devices such as computer displays and televisions, one of the primary light sources is typically a narrow-spectrum yellowish-green of dominant wavelength ~550 nm; this "green" primary is combined with an orangish-red "red" primary and a purplish-blue "blue" primary to produce any color in between – the RGB color model. A unique green (green appearing neither yellowish nor bluish) is produced on such a device by mixing light from the green primary with some light from the blue primary. 

Warm colors are red, yellow, orange, gold, beige, creamy neutrals, brown, and tan. 
Warm colors will always add a sense of calm and security to a space.

warm colours convey joy, passion, sensuality

 cold colours are associated with sweetness and rest. 
 Cold colours are: green, blue, indigo and violet.

RGB
Additive color method for screen displays

CMYK
Subtractive color method
CMYK color stands for cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K for “key” and black), and is the color mode used by commercial printing equipment to create full-color graphics and images. The printing process involves combining varying 
amounts of the different color inks to produce a full spectrum of color.

Design involving print are very difficult be cautious with
these

Things may be different

If you are going to print something do a test run early
to see colors if they match what you are looking for

Paint mixes differently

Hard to match colors 

Different displays have better quality than others

Test different displays

Rendering can affect colors as well

Sometimes mixing in colors with others can make
colors you would'nt expect also
adding and subtracting can affect them as well

Colors are hard

SaaS products may most of the time involve neutral
colors

Colors qualities
hue is just another way to say color 
saturation is how strong that color is
value which is another way of saying shade

60-30-10 color rule keep this in mind in software design
Great for trying to find colors to use

60% of our neutral or our base color
In this case use neutral color or creamy color or a while color.
If its a dark interface use a dark color

can use width to help you know which one is which

Try to use primary colors for important areas.
Call to action color only in very important areas(and other things)
10 for small things 

// Keep in mind Jesse Showalter watch more of his video

Tint refers to any hue or mixture of pure colors to which white is added. Pastel colors are generally tinted colors. Tinted color 
remains the same color, but it is paler than the original.

Tone is a hue or mixture of pure colors to which only pure gray is added (equal amounts of black and white). Adding gray to a color will make the intensity much duller. Beware of mixing too much gray into a hue as it can become over-dulled 
and virtually impossible to restore the brilliance. 

Shade is how much black you are adding to the color
Tint is how much white you are adding to the color
Tone is a combination of both the medium of both you are adding
to the color

Try to scale color saturation down a bit since it can look a
bit too strong 

RYB (an abbreviation of red–yellow–blue) is a subtractive color model used in art and applied design in which red, yellow, and blue pigments are considered primary colors.[1] Under traditional color theory, this set of primary colors was advocated by Moses Harris, Michel Eugène Chevreul, Johannes Itten and Josef Albers, and applied by countless artists and designers. The RYB color model underpinned the color curriculum of the Bauhaus, Ulm School of Design and numerous art and design schools that were influenced by the Bauhaus, including the IIT Institute of Design (founded as the New Bauhaus), Black Mountain College, Design Department Yale University, the Shillito Design School, Sydney, and Parsons School of Design, New York.

In this context, the term primary color refers to three exemplar colors (red, yellow, and blue) as opposed to specific pigments. As illustrated, in the RYB color model, red, yellow, and blue are intermixed to create secondary color segments of orange, green, and purple. This set of primary colors emerged at a time when access to a large range of pigments was limited by availability and cost, and it encouraged artists and designers to explore the many nuances of color through mixing and intermixing a limited range of pigment colors. In art and design education, red, yellow, and blue pigments were usually augmented with white and black pigments, enabling the creation of a larger gamut of color nuances including tints and shades.

Although scientifically obsolete because it does not meet the definition of a complementary color in which a neutral or black color must be mixed, it is still a model used in artistic environments, causing confusion about primary and complementary colors.

The RYB color model relates specifically to color in the form of paint and pigment application in art and design.[2] Other common color models include the light model (RGB) and the paint, pigment and ink CMY color model, which is much more accurate in terms of color gamut and intensity compared to the traditional RYB color model, the latter emerging in 
conjunction with the CMYK color model in the printing industry. 

To find complementary colors go to a color and look at the color
on the opposite side of the one you are using etc.

Keep in mind "Traditional" RYB Color Model
and RGB Color Model

Split complementary is the colors next to the opposite ones
on the color wheel on the left and right
Analogous is the colors next to each other on the color wheel
Monochromatic involves shades and tints for the colors

May see a lot of monochromatic in software design

Triadic is equal spacing between colors
like 3 for example 

Might be good for a book cover,graphic design,60 30 10 rule

Good for other shades and hues as well might be the way to go
as well as movie posters

Tetradic

is 4 colors good for movies complement each other well

Look into canva tool on figma or wherever

Color meanings and symbolism tool look into this as well

WebAIM study this

Contrast ratio is very important for text when it comes to color
60 30 10 rule here keep all this in mind

Think about all kinds of conditions like nighttime,etc.

Contrast tool // look into this

Look into retina displays
Deals with 8 pixel gird rgb
and way the pixels are set up

Look into color theory

Try to make things interactive with voice

to make a degree on mac shift option 8

on drag

r key to refresh prototype on mac
might be same for windows

     You can quickly toggle between the Design and Prototype tabs using the keyboard shortcut Shift + E. 

Recently, Figma has a shortcut to present: Mac: ⌘ Cmd + ⌥ Opt + Return Windows: Ctrl + Alt + Enter 

Can change text style to medium,etc. In the right menu

To make button make a rectangle,remove fill and add a stroke
to make it look awesome and border radius to get rounded
corners

To get really rounded curves look the hieght and put in that
number divided by 2 sum or type in 1000 to be lazy

Can also make an auto on the left menu things 

Auto layout stuff affects all elements that are the unique way

A design system is a set of components for your product 
that you reuse the components throughout your entire product
like a primary button

Consistency makes a better product

command z or something like to undo change

To make a special menu make a frame then go to effects
then drop shadow and alter the blur
the more blur you give it the more it feathers

Increase opacity in it to make it stand out more
1 for x and 2 for y is usually enough
Slight opacity is also better maybe for this circumstance

Wireframing do this before any real figma project helps
you plan out exactly what you are going to do

can find lo-fi wireframe on community

Can make the stroke dash like

Helps give an outline if what you want

Try using various wireframes to consider possible styles
of design

In copy/paste as option there call copy properties can paste
the properties onto other things as well with
paste properties

Select all layers of something and go to top menu where there
is 2 squares where there are 4 options: Union selection,
subtract selection,intersect selection and flatten selection

Subtract selection takes what on top and subtract from the
thing beneath
it

changes the layers you selected on the left to what you did
in this case subtract

And if you need to resize one of the layers still works normal

Press l for a line

arrow is shift l
eclipse is o (circle)
also have acess to star 

When things are all in union selection stroke affects them all

Redacted script really useful in specific circumstances like making a music app
can find it in fonts for text

can add a blurry frame with picture over empty frame maybe to make it
look interesting


if you keep clicking on an element you might a bunch of 
horizontal lines
create a pen or whatever tool where you alter the shape
of the element or position maybe

Every element that you interact with in figma is really
a vector grpahic and they all have anchors
Hit escape to get out of this mode

Exclude selection allows you to see certain parts of your layers
that dont cross over

Make sure you select multiple layers before doing this
Ex: Blue and green circles

Keep in mind framer very similar to figma

Everything in framer is a frame

layers on left and customization on right like in figma

f key for frame

Go to insert to find a lot of templates you can drag into
framer

Other options in insert to like slideshow for example

In slideshow can connect a lot of frames to make 
a sildeshow

Can change direction 

Can auto play or not

How long it takes to autoplay

Yes or no for draggable

clipping 

can fade when its not the actual slide you want it to fade if you say
yes

And can show overflow

Frames will overflow pass frame if connected

T for text

Go to insert for a ticker

Make things move on their own

Can alter ticker speed and other things

Might have to go to insert first then click T to put text in

Click on publish on top right if you want people to see this

What happens after you click this is Framer creates an entire
website available to be viewed online gives you random URL
and you can customize the URL if you want

Can create breakpoints in Framer by clicking a frame
then selecting various options like a phone,etc.

Shows you what something looks like when it's this

Go to pages and click + to add new page

Can link pages

Like put the text about in home page and go to link on right
and select where you want it to link to

Can add custom domain in publish

Settings in top right to do custom things

Can unpublish from here

can add scroll effect as well

Automatically scrolls without effect anyway if you bring height
down for certain stuff cant see it

Users often perceive asthetically pleasing design as design that's
more usable

Read creative selection by ken kocienda

To make ring around a snapchat icon use stroke in another circle
then put it inside another circle with an image in it

To make things scroll make things overlap frames and 
bring the box to the edge of the frame

hen you have content that is overflowing the frame that the
content is in needs to be smaller than the content
To make scrolling effect

Then go to prototype and go to scroll behaviour

and go to overflow and can select various scrolling
behaviours in this horizontal

Be careful with scrolling with components
will only work if you apply it to the main one

Be careful with mobile phones the names dont go on the top 
things

Be careful with where you click when you are prototying

Try to ensure that your design elements in your frames are within the frame
that you want

Use lines and stuff to make bars on bottom of phones

1000ms thing in figma effect

Click for new figma tab then click new figjam file
here you can make shapes and do other stuff

Like a whiteboarding tool

Text on bottom bar here

User journey: the entire journey the user's gonna go through

select side on square and it will turn blue with arrow can click this and drag it to other things creating
a squiggly line in the process

Customers will pay a premium for well-designed products

Human-centered design is about solving problems,not implementing solutions.It's also about
outcomes,measurable changes in customer behaviour that are the indicators of success and value

The aim of a design sprint is to create and test ideas quickly

Start at the end maybe
 - Map
Ask the experts
Target

Remix and improve
 - Sketch

- Decide 
Rumble
Storyboard

- Prototype

- Test 
Learn

Monday's structured discussions create a path for
the sprint week.In the morning, you'll start at the end
and agree to a long-term goal.Next,you'll make a map of the challenge.
In the afternoon, you'll ask the experts at your company to share what they know.
Finally,you'll pick a target:an ambitious but manageable piece of the problem
that you can solve in 1 week

Other stuff too

Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation - anchored in understanding customer's
needs,rapid prototyping,and generating creative ideas - thst will transform the way you develop products,services,
processes,and organizations.By using design thinkong,you make decisions based on what customers really want
instead of relying only on historical data or making risky bets based on instinct instead of evidence

Design thinking brings together what is desirable from a human point of view with what is technologically
feasible and economically viable

Desiriability:What makes sense to people and for people?

Feasibility:What is technically possible within the foreseeable future?

Viability: What is likely to become part of a sustainable business model?

Human-Centered Design(HCD) focuses on people's everyday thinking,
emotions,and behavior. It is a creative approach to problem-solving
that involves the end-user from the very beginning and places them
at the center of the digital design process

Human-Centered Design is a unique approach to problem solving,one that can occasionally feel more
like madness than method - but you rarely get to new and innovative solutions if you always know precisely
where you're going

Great Ux designers help teams and stakeholders make better decisions by using questions
to identify questions to identify opportunities,reveal underlying needs,and
understand user context

Human-centered design is an iterative process.

The 6 phases of the HCD process are:

1.Observation
2.Ideation
3.Rapid Prototyping
4.user Feedbck - User Testing
5. Iteration
6.Implementation

Learning from failure is central to HCD

"Dont think of it as failure,think of it as designing
experiments through which you're going to learn"

General magic documentary // watch it

Human-centered design starts from a place of not knowing what the soltion to a igiven design challenge might be. Only by listening,
thinking,building,and refining our way to an answer do we get something that will work for the people we're trying
to serve

More and more personal and professional business is conducted online,and users have come to expect an optimized,friction-free digital
experience across all platforms and devices

In framer hold down shift and select a couple of layers right click and add frame to wrap them in a frame

GENERATIVE AI

Prompt design is the process of creating a prompt that is
clear,concise and informative

It is an important part of natural language processing

A typical LLM use case is Question Answering

What is question answering in Nautral Language Processing?

Question answering(QA) is a subfield of natural language
processing that deals with the task of automatically
answering questions posed in natural language.

Question answering models are able to retrieve the answer
to a question from a given text.This is useful for searching
for an answer in a document.Depending on the model used,
the answer can be directly extracted from text or generated
from scratch

QA systems are typically trained on a large amount of text
and code

Can answer factual,definitional and opinion-based questions

Domain knowledge is required to develop a question
answering model for customer IT support or health care,
or supply chain.

Big Tech

Pharma and Healthcare
Provide info for patient
self-management

Retail

Supply/Chain 
Provide logistics info on inventory info

Generative QA

- Generates free text directly based on the context
- It leverages text generation models
- No need for domain knowledge


In each question a desired response was obtained this is due
to prompt design

Prompt design is the process of creating prompts that elicit
the desired response from a language model.

What are Prompts and Prompt Engineering?

Prompt Design

Prompts involve instructions
and context passed to a language model to achieve
a desired task.

Prompt Engineering

Prompt Engineering is the practice of
developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently
use language models for a variety of applications

Prompt design is the process of creating a prompt
that is tailored to the specific task that this system is
being asked to perform. For example if the system
is being asked to translate a text from english to french,
the prompt should be written in english and should specify
that the translation should be in french

Prompt engineering is the process of creating a prompt
that is designed to improve performance.This may
involve using domain-specific knowledge,providing examples
of the desired output,or using keywords that are known to be
effective for the specific system

Prompt design is a more general concept,while
prompt engineering is a more specialized concept

Prompt design is essential while prompt engineering is
only necessary for systems that require a high degree of
accuracy or performance

There are 3 main kinds of LLM,each needs prompting in a different
way.
The first 2 are easily confused and give very different outputs.

Generic(or Raw) Language Models | These predict the next(technically
    token) based on the language in the training data.

Instruction TUned | Trained to predict a response to the instructions
given in the input. 

Dialog Tuned | Trained to have a dialog by predicting the next
response.

To get to the color contrast checker go to
webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ 

Can use hexadecimal form here

for black it's #000000

for an off white background its #e3e3e3

Once the foreground and background colors have been entered,
the checker will display the contrast ratio of the
colors selected

In addition the checker will also display a Pass or Fail
indicato for normal and large text based on the ratios specified
in the WCAG .0 guidelines

Firefox add-on available called Colorzilla which can be
used to determine the hexadecimal code of any web-based
element.

To find out more about colorzilla go to www.colorzilla.com/firefox

WebAIM's free color contrast checker provides an easy
way to verify the selected colors meet WCAG 2.0 guidelines

Contrast Checker API and Bookmarklet

This tool also functions as a basic API.Simply append &api to
any permalink to get a JSON object with the contrast ratio 
and the AA/AAA pass/fail states.For ex:

Contrast by willowtree

Contrast makes it easy to check the contrast ratios of colors as you work. Select a layer and Contrast will immediately look for the color directly behind your selection and serve up the contrast ratio along with passing and failing levels from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). If Contrast cannot find the background color, add another layer to your selection, and Contrast will compare them both.


Are you looking to give everything a once-over before finishing? Scan entire pages to generate a report of all text-based contrast issues. Step through them and fix issues as needed.


    Select elements to automatically find the color behind them
    Scan entire pages or the current selection to see all text-layer color issues
    Works on any element, not just text
    Extremely fast and responsive—keep it open as you work
    Supports image and gradient backgrounds with Smart Sampling
    Supports solid, transparent, blended fills, layered fills, and backgrounds
    Live updates as you change the color, opacity, or blend of the selected element


APCA Support (Beta)

Contrast now includes Beta support for the Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA) algorithm. Calculate contrast using APCA, a new method for calculating and predicting readability contrast. This method is continuously evolving. APCA W3 is in public beta and use of the algorithm in Contrast is a work in progress. Please share your thoughts with us! We'll continue to post updates and new approaches over time.


Smart Sampling

Contrast can compare an element’s color with the colors it finds in gradients and images in the background. It does this by taking a sampling of colors from the area directly behind the element and calculating the contrast ratio for each color. Contrast considers a color passing if all colors in the sample pass.


Bugs

If you have a situation where Contrast is not finding the right background, please let us know! Send us an example test case in Figma along with a short description of what you were expecting, and we’ll have a look.


Known Issues

    Element strokes are not yet supported


Smart Sampling Technique

Contrast uses RGBQuant to analyze the selection of pixels behind an element. It looks for colors (pixels) that are represented two or more times within each sub-region (64x64) of the area tested. This method gives the best balance of speed and results. The time it takes Contrast to sample and analyze the colors is proportional to the size of the layer you are testing. I.e., Larger layers, in terms of area, will take longer than smaller areas. Sampling can temporarily block the interface in the same way that exporting a frame might—this shouldn’t be very noticeable for smaller layers.
